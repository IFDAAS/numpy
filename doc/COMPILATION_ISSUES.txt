Compilation issues
==================

Here we document common issues that occur when compiling numpy or scipy.


OS X

::

  $ python2.5 setup.py install
  ...
  cc1: error: unrecognized command line option "-Wno-long-double"
  ...
  RuntimeError: Broken toolchain: cannot link a simple C program
  
The reason is that Python 2.5 expects gcc-4.0 to be the default compiler, not
gcc-4.2 as on Snow Leopard. This should work::

  $ CC=gcc-4.0 python2.5 setup.py install

XXX: check this is the case.
This is due to c++ being c++-4.2 instead of c++-4.0. The solution is to either
do ``$ export CXX=/usr/bin/c++-4.0`` or to softlink c++ to /usr/bin/c++-4.0 and
put that link somewhere at the front of the PATH.
