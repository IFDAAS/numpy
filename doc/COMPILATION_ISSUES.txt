Compilation issues
==================

OS X
----
::

  $ python2.5 setup.py install
  ...
  cc1: error: unrecognized command line option "-Wno-long-double"
  ...
  RuntimeError: Broken toolchain: cannot link a simple C program
  
The reason is that Python 2.5 expects gcc-4.0 to be the default compiler, not
gcc-4.2 as on Snow Leopard. This should work::

  $ CC=gcc-4.0 python2.5 setup.py install
